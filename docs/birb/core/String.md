# String type

An array of chars (UTF-16) code units.

A data type used mainly to represent text, denoted by the `'` or `"`s its wrapped within.

Strings in birb are multiline by default:

```dart
screm("This string will print on one line");

// OR

screm("
This String
will print on two lines
");
```

You can use the `+` operator to concat Strings:

```dart
screm("Henlo " + "birb!") // "Henlo birb!"
```
