# Setup

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/Calamity210/Birb.git`.
2. Move in to the Birb directory and run the `make` command, I'll get cmake ready as soon as I get a hint of motivation.
3. You should now have a new executable birb file, add that to your path.
4. You can now run the it with the command `birb path/to/birb/file.birb`
