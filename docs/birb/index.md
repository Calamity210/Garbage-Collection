~~Tutorial~~ Documentation for my small birb language

# Birb
Minimal Birb programming language

# Contribution

- Clone the repo from https://github.com/Calamity210/BirbLang
- Navigate to the new directory and install birb by running:
```shell
$ dart2native lib/Birb.dart
```
I personally like to run:
```shell
$ dart2native lib/Birb.dart -o birb
```
so the output isn't in a `.exe` format.

- When ready, open and pull request and request a review from me - Calamity210.
