# Setup
NOTE: This was a project to cure boredom, I am not mantaining it and it has ***only** been tested on Windows so far.

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/Calamity210/Birb.git`.
2. Move in to the Birb directory and run the `cmak` command, I'll haven't added any cmake files to the repo yet but it shouldn't be too bad...right?
3. You should now have a new executable birb file, add that to your path.
4. You can now run the it with the command `birb path/to/birb/file.birb`
